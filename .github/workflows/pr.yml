  # TODO: Add CI check for Prisma formatting and schema/migration drift.

  # TODO: Add a job (maybe called `dev`?) that spins up the Docker Compose local
  # development environment and runs some smoke tests (maybe ideally this would
  # be an integration testing job?) to make sure we didn't break it (e.g. right
  # now, we don't actually test that the `migrate` image builds and functions
  # properly).

  # TODO: Add a job (maybe called `setup` or `onboarding`?) that literally
  # performs the onboarding/setup/quickstart instructions we've documented to
  # make sure they actually work as expected.
