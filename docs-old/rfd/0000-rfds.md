# RFDs

For now, we're using these mostly as [decision logs](https://infraeng.dev/decision-log/) or [ADRs](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record). Inspired by [Oxide](https://oxide.computer/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion/) and [Teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0000-rfds.md).

## Format

- Store them in `docs/rfd`.
- Create branches named `rfd/NUMBER-TITLE`.
- Claim numbers by pushing the branch to the repository.
- Prefer sequential numbering, and use this snippet to get the next unclaimed number:
  ```
  git fetch --quiet && git branch -r -v | grep origin/rfd/ | awk -F'[/,-]' '{ n=$3+0; print n }' | sort -n | tail -n 1
  ```
- Implementation, especially prototyping, is not blocked on finalization.
