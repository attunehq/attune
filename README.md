Attune is a tool for securely publishing and hosting Linux packages.

- **Flexible deployment:** Deploy a self-hosted package repository, or use our managed cloud infrastructure.
- **Secure by design:** Attune's CLI does repository index signing locally, so you can own your signing keys without ever exposing them.
- **Really, really fast:** Attune does incremental repository index rebuilds, so adding and removing packages is really fast.

We currently support publishing APT (Debian and Ubuntu) repositories, with more [coming soon](https://attunehq.com).

## Installing and Running
